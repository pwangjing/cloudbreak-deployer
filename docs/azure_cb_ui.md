## Manage cloud credentials

You can now log into the Cloudbreak application at http://PUBLIC_IP:3000. Once logged in go to **Manage credentials**. Using manage credentials will  link your cloud account with the Cloudbreak account.
If you do not have an Azure Resource manager application you can simply create it with Cloudbreak deployer. Please read the [Provisioning prerequisites](azure_pre_provision.md) for more information.

`Name:` name of your credential

`Description:` short description of your linked credential

`Subscription Id:` your Azure subscription id - see Accounts (Browse all> Subscription)

`Password:` your password which was setted up when you create the AD app

`App ID:` You app Id (`Browse all`> `Subscription`> `Subscription detail`> `Users`> `You application`> `Properties`)

`App Owner Tenant ID:` You Tenant Id (`Browse all`> `Subscription`> `Subscription detail`> `Users`> `You application`> `Properties`)

`SSH public key:` the SSH public key in OpenSSH format that's private keypair can be used to log into the launched instances later

> Cloudbreak supporting simple rsa public key instead of X509 certificate file after 1.0.4 version

The ssh username is **cloudbreak**

##Manage resources

Using manage resources you can create infrastructure templates. Templates describes the infrastructure where the HDP cluster will be provisioned. We support heterogenous clusters - this means that one cluster can be built by combining different templates.

`Name:` name of your template

`Description:` short description of your template

`Instance type:` the Azure instance type to be used

`Attached volumes per instance:` the number of disks to be attached

`Volume size (GB):` the size of the attached disks (in GB)

`Public in account:` share it with others in the account

## Manage blueprints
Blueprints are your declarative definition of a Hadoop cluster.

`Name:` name of your blueprint

`Description:` short description of your blueprint

`Source URL:` you can add a blueprint by pointing to a URL. As an example you can use this [blueprint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequenceiq/cloudbreak/master/core/src/main/resources/defaults/blueprints/multi-node-hdfs-yarn.bp).

`Manual copy:` you can copy paste your blueprint in this text area

`Public in account:` share it with others in the account

## Manage networks

Manage networks allows you to create or reuse existing networks and configure them.

`Name:` name of the network

`Description:` short description of your network

`Subnet (CIDR):` a subnet in the VPC with CIDR block

`Address prefix (CIDR):` the address space that is used for subnets

`Public in account:` share it with others in the account

## Manage security groups

Security groups allows configuration of traffic/access to the cluster. Currently there are two default groups, and later versions will allow setup of new groups.

`only-ssh-and-ssl:` all ports are locked down (you can't access Hadoop services outside of the VPN)

* SSH (22)
* HTTPS (443)

`all-services-port:` all Hadoop services + SSH/HTTP are accessible by default:

* SSH (22)
* HTTPS (443)
* Ambari (8080)
* Consul (8500)
* NN (50070)
* RM Web (8088)
* Scheduler (8030RM)
* IPC (8050RM)
* Job history server (19888)
* HBase master (60000)
* HBase master web (60010)
* HBase RS (16020)
* HBase RS info (60030)
* Falcon (15000)
* Storm (8744)
* Hive metastore (9083)
* Hive server (10000)
* Hive server HTTP (10001)
* Accumulo master (9999)
* Accumulo Tserver (9997)
* Atlas (21000)
* KNOX (8443)
* Oozie (11000)
* Spark HS (18080)
* NM Web (8042)
* Zeppelin WebSocket (9996)
* Zeppelin UI (9995)
* Kibana (3080)
* Elasticsearch (9200) 

## Create a cluster

Using the create cluster functionality Cloudbreak will create a cloud Stack and a Hadoop Cluster. In order to create a cluster you will have to select a credential first.

`Cluster name:` your cluster name

`Region:` the region where the cluster is started

`Network:` the network template

`Security Group:` the security group

`Blueprint:` your Hadoop cluster blueprint. Once the blueprint is selected we parse it and give you the option to select the followings for each **hostgroup**.

`Hostgroup configuration`

  `Group size:` the number of instances to be started

  `Template:` the stack template associated to the hostgroup

`DASH Account Name:` values printed by Cloudbreak deployer when the DASH service was deployed

`DASH Account Key:` values printed by Cloudbreak deployer when the DASH service was deployed

  **Important:** For better performance DASH service and the Cloudbreak cluster must be in the same Azure region.

`Enable security:` Install KDC and Kerberize the cluster

`Public in account:` share it with others in the account

**Advanced features**:

`Consul server count:` the number of Consul servers (odd number), by default is 3. It varies with the cluster size.

`Minimum cluster size:` the provisioning strategy in case of the cloud provider can't allocate all the requested nodes

`Validate blueprint:` feature to validate or not the Ambari blueprint. By default is switched on.

`Ambari Repository config:` you can take the stack RPM's from a custom stack repository

Once you have launched the cluster creation you can track the progress either on Cloudbreak UI or your cloud provider management UI.
